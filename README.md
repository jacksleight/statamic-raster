# Raster

<!-- /statamic:hide -->

Easily rasterize views and partials to images by dropping in a tag and fetching a URL. Automatic scaling, caching, protection and preview mode. Zero configuration (unless you need it).

## Installation

Run the following command from your project root:

```bash
composer require jacksleight/statamic-raster
```

This package uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) via [spatie/browsershot](https://spatie.be/docs/browsershot/v4/introduction) under the hood, you will also need follow the necessary Puppeteer [installation steps](https://spatie.be/docs/browsershot/v4/requirements) for your system. I can't help with Puppeteer issues, sorry.

If you need to customise the config you can publish it with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="statamic-raster-config"
```

## Usage

### Layout Setup

The views will be rendered inside a layout view where you can load any required CSS and other assets. By default it looks for a template called `raster`, but you can configure it in the config file.

```antlers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <title>Raster</title>
        {{ vite src="resources/css/app.css" }}
    </head>
    <body class="bg-black text-white">
        {{ $template_content }}
    </body>
</html>
```

### Simple Mode (Automatic Routing)

To make a view rasterizeable simply implement the main `raster` tag and then generate a URL to your image using the `raster:url` tag.

```antlers
{{# resources/views/blog/hero.antlers.html #}}
{{ %raster
    width="1000"
}}
<div>
    <svg>...</svg>
    <h1>{{ $post:title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ $post:date }}</p>
</div>
```

```antlers
{{# resources/views/blog/show.antlers.html #}}
{{ push:head }}
    <meta property="og:image" content="{{ raster:blog/hero }}">
{{ /push:head }}
```

The current content will be detected automatically and its data passed to the view. You can override this by adding a `:content="entry_id"` atribute to the URL tag.

You can set [options](#options) with the main tag or through the URL with URL tag. The options passed in the URL take priority over options set in the main tag.

When the view is rendered during normal non-raster requests the tag does nothing.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Views rasterised using simple mode must implement the raster tag.

### Advanced Mode (Manual Routing)

If you would like more control over the routing and how the requests are handled you can define your own routes that return raster responses and then generate a URL to your image using the usual `route` tag.

```antlers
{{# resources/views/blog/hero.antlers.html #}}
<div>
    <svg>...</svg>
    <h1>{{ $post:title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ $post:date }}</p>
</div>
```

```php
/* routes/web.php */
use JackSleight\StatamicRaster\Raster;
use Statamic\Facades\Entry;

Route::get('/blog/{entry}/hero', function (Request $request, $entry) {
    return (new Raster('blog.hero', Entry::find($entry)))->width(1000);
})->name('blog.hero');
```

```blade
{{# resources/views/layout.antlers.html #}}
<meta property="og:image" content="{{ route:blog.hero :entry="id" }}">
```

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Views rasterised using advanced mode must not implement the raster tag.

## Customising Rasterized Views

If you would like to make changes to the view based on whether or not it's being rasterized you can check for the `$raster` variable:

```antlers
<div {{ [
    'rounded-none' => $raster,
] | classes }}>
</div>
```

## Options

The following options can be set with the main tag or URL tag:

* **width (int)**  
  Width of the generated image.
* **height (int, auto)**  
  Height of the generated image.
* **basis (int)**  
  [Viewport basis](#viewport-basis) of the generated image. 
* **scale (int, 1)**  
  Scale factor of the generated image (1, 2 or 3).
* **type (string, png)**  
  Type of the generated image (`png`, `jpeg` or `pdf`).
* **preview (bool, false)**  
  Enable [preview mode](#preview-mode).
* **cache (bool|int, false)**  
  Cache image generation, `true` for forever or `int` for seconds.  
  Cannot be set from a route parameter.

## Viewport Basis

When the basis option is set the image will be generated as if the viewport was that width, but the final image will match the desired width. Here's an example of how that affects output:

![Viewport Basis](https://jacksleight.dev/assets/packages/statamic-raster/viewport-basis.jpg)

## Preview Mode

In preview mode the HTML will be returned from the response but with all the appropriate scaling applied. This gives you a 1:1 preview without the latency that comes from generating the actual image.

## Security & URL Signing

Only views that implement the `raster` tag can be rasterized in simple mode, an error will be thrown before execution if they don't. It's also recommended to enable URL signing on production to ensure they can't be tampered with. You can do this by setting the `RASTER_SIGN_URLS` .env var to `true`.

## Customising Browsershot

If you need to customise the Browsershot instance you can pass a closure to `Raster::browsershot()` in a service provider:

```php
use JackSleight\StatamicRaster\Raster;

Raster::browsershot(fn ($browsershot) => $browsershot
    ->setOption('args', ['--disable-web-security'])
    ->waitUntilNetworkIdle()
);
```
